## Welcome To the Party!

Hello! Welcome to my personal page! I decided to create a GitHub repo just for myself.
I intend to use this page to just show to other people what I have created so far during
my coding career. To do so, every file that I create from here on out will be uploaded
here!

### Intro

My name is Matthew (I prefer Matt) Evans and I'm currently an undergrad at Northern
Illinois University (NIU). With my Junior year coming to a close, I got just a little bit
more schooling before I head off to the real world!

I'm pursuing a Computer Science degree with an emphasis on Computational Software along with
a minor in Applied Mathematics. My plan as of right now is to graduate in the Winter of 2023.
To tell the truth, I actually have only been working on this degree for 1 1/2 years now.
I originally started out college as a Computer Engineering major, only to find out that
it just wasn't for me in the Fall of my Sophomore year.

Switching to Computer Science has been one of the best decisions I've made in my time at NIU.
Programming has been a blast, and I'm eager to learn more and become a perennial prorammer!

### The Why???

Why did I decide to do this? With the demand of computer programmers and software engineers
in today's world being extremely high, I figured one of the best ways I can showcase what I've
accomplished is through here!

### Progress...

So far, the bulk of my coding has been done in college, with a bit more coming. I plan on
taking this summer to create a personal project that I've been thinking about a lot
recently... a website! I think that creating a personal website would be great to show off
what I can do!

### Learned Languages

The following languages listed below are ones that I've learned so far in my academic career:
***C/C++***
***HTML***
***PHP***
***SQL (MariaDB)***
***IBM Assembler***

### What I Use to Code

Current: Neovim (AstroNvim on WSL)
Former: VSCode (Through NIU Servers w/ SSH)

When I first started out, I just followed along with DevC++, then transitioned to Nano.
Nano became a bit too simple and boring really quickly, so I made the switch to VSCode
and used that for a while. Now, I grew old of VSCode and decided to try out Neovim.

Since my PC's OS is Windows 10, I enabled the use of WSL and use Debian as my subsystem.
My editor is AstroNvim, an all-in-one Neovim config that eliminates the hassle of 
setting up Neovim, where all of the plugins and configurations are set up for me.
AstroNvim provides a VSCode-like experience, but it's refreshing to be on a different
environment.

#### I hope you enjoy my GitHub page!
